Description: utility to monitor Linux input device events
 evtest monitors a Linux input device, displaying all the events it
 generates.
 .
 It can be used to determine mice button bindings, keymaps for exotic
 keyboards... It is commonly used to debug issues with input devices
 in X.Org.
 .
 evtest is now in maintenance mode and doesn't support all the
 features of the latest kernels; evemu-record from the evemu-tools
 package should be used instead.
